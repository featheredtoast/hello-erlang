# Hello Erlang

Nothing special here, this is just so I can break out of the mold of never getting around to writing in erlang.

I'm all for the actor model, but need some practice. Taught as an OO guy, I am used to the data being where the function is, rather than being completely separate. So this is an exercise to get myself comfortable with other data models more in line with functional fun.

## Scope

I'm starting off with simple data structures - dicts, maps, trees, tables, what not. Then moving in to writing some OTP like objects - servers, events, fsms, supervisors.

Then I'm going to look into properly setting up logging so that I can keep track of state as data moves through a system. This also probably includes process/program properties, loading from a .d folder, etc.

Next I'm taking off to the wild west: Cowboy and its ilk. I suppose we could include ports and the like as well. This probably also includes rebar integration, proper module-ing, and hopefully learning about some amount of namespacing.

After that, who knows. Hopefully by then I'll be more comfortable in the paradigm to start to know the languages strengths and weaknesses. I could dive further into message passing, multiprocessing/distributed systems. Or other libraries and persistent data stores, such as how to hook up to riak, mariadb, and that land. Perhaps language ports.
